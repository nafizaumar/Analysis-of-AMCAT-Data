Title: **AMCAT Exam Results – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Project Overview**
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on AMCAT exam results to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between test scores, academic background, and placement outcomes.
The dataset contains AMCAT section scores, demographic details, and salary information.
Note: The dataset is private and not included in this repository.

**Objectives**
- Understand the distribution of AMCAT section scores.
- Identify correlations between section scores and salaries.
- Explore differences in performance based on gender and academic background.
- Visualize patterns for data-driven career insights.

**Tools & Libraries**
- Python – Data Analysis
- Pandas – Data Cleaning & Exploration
- NumPy – Numerical Computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data Visualization

**Methodology**
1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and missing values.
- Checked data types and converted where necessary.
2. Univariate Analysis
- Countplots & histograms for categorical and numerical features.
3. Bivariate Analysis
- Scatterplots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Compared section scores with job roles and salaries.
4. Insights Extraction
- Identified high-impact features for higher salaries.
- Found demographic and academic patterns.

**Key Insights**
1. Logical Ability and English scores showed strong correlation with salary.
2. Certain job roles consistently required higher aptitude scores.
3. Gender and academic background impacted placement trends.
4. Detected outliers in salary and section scores.

**Project Impact**
The insights from this project can:
- Help recruiters set data-backed cutoffs for job roles.
- Assist career coaches in guiding students on skill improvement areas.
- Aid organizations in designing targeted training programs.
